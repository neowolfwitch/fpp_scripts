This is a repository of my FPP scripts, used for Oak Hills Lights.

Most of these are linked from https://lunardenlights.com

I'm including most older versions as they show progression and some of the older code may be useful to others.

These scripts apply to my unique show/situation and are being shared to inspire similar projects for others.
