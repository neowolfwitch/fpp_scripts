***This software is distributed AS-IS without support.*** 

I have a "day job" and just don't have time to provide technical support for this stuff. There are a lot of resources available online for xLights, FPP, Arduino, C, PHP, etc, and my code is well-commented. Please do not attempt to compile or use anything here unless you have a high level of comfort with the tools involved.

Many resources can be found here: https://lunardenlights.com/pixel-resources/

...and here: https://lunardenlights.com/terminology/

I'm happy to respond to feedback, suggestions, and simple questions as I have time, but I can't support xLights, FPP, Arduino IDE, or Visual Studio Code.

Thanks!

Wolf I. Butler
